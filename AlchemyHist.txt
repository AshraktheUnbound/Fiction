The Fourth Ascension
	The Iron People rise from the ashes of the Bronze. The Great Conjunction occurs blanketing the earth into eternal darkness.
	
Zozimos of Panopolis
	 The treatises of Zosimos of Panopolis, the earliest historically attested author (fl. c. 300 AD), can help in situating the other authors. Zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors, such as Mary the Jewess, Pseudo-Democritus, and Agathodaimon, but very little is known about any of these authors. The most complete of their works, The Four Books of Pseudo-Democritus, were probably written in the first century AD.

Hermes Trismegistus
	 The Hermetica of Thrice-Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice, called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners. These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era. 
	 
Diocletian
	 The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy, extending back to 3500 BC. Many writings were lost when the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria (AD 292). Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived, most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X. Dating from AD 250–300, they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones, cleaning and fabricating pearls, and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver.[citation needed] These writings lack the mystical, philosophical elements of alchemy, but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes (or Pseudo-Democritus), which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements. Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos, the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art.

Pseudo-Democritus 
	The name used by scholars for the anonymous authors of a number of Greek writings that were falsely attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus (c. 460–370 BC). 
	Several of these writings, most notably the lost works On Sympathies and Antipathies and Artificial Substances (Greek: Cheirokmēta), were probably written by the Pythagorean physician and pharmacologist Bolos of Mendes (fl. 3rd or 2d century BC).[1] 

Bolus of Mendes 
	 A philosopher, a neopythagorean writer of works of esoterica and medicine, in Ptolemaic Egypt. He is described as one who wrote on marvels, potent remedies, and astronomical phenomena. The Suda, however, also describes a separate Bolus who was a philosopher of the school of Democritus,[6] who wrote Inquiry, and Medical Art, containing "natural medical remedies from some resources of nature." However, from a passage of Columella,[7] it appears that Bolos of Mendes and this other Bolus, follower of Democritus, were one and the same person.[5] He seems to have lived following the time of Theophrastus, whose work Historia Plantarum ('On Plants'), Bolus appears to have known.[8]

Bolus was either an ancient Greek[9][10] or a Hellenized Egyptian.[11][12] 
	 
	 
Four Books

The original alchemical works attributed to Democritus, known as the Four Books, are now lost.[4] However, several epitomized extracts of them survive in two extant treatises called Natural and Secret Questions (Greek: Physika kai Mystika) and On the Making of Silver (Greek: Peri asēmou poiēseōs), as well as in a collection of lists of alchemical substances called Catalogues (Greek: Katalogoi).[5] The original books dealt with a wide range of topics, including the transmutation of base metals into silver or gold, the artificial production of precious stones, and the purple-dyeing of wool, all of which are subjects also covered in the Stockholm and Leyden papyri (3rd century AD). However, the preserved parts focus more strongly on the production of silver and gold, thus reflecting the main interests of later Greek alchemists.[6]

The original works were probably four books on dyeing: one on how to give base metals a yellow tinge (i.e., to 'dye' them gold), one on how to give base metals a white tinge (i.e., to 'dye' them silver), one on 'dyeing' stones (i.e., to create precious stones), and one on dyeing fabrics purple (using cheaper substitutes for the costly Tyrian purple).[7] 
	 
The Four Books are some of the most ancient works known in Western alchemy, and played a central role in its earliest development. They were frequently cited by alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis (fl. c. 300 AD) and Synesius (c. 373–414 AD), as well as by later Byzantine writers such as pseudo-Olympiodorus, Stephanus, Christianus, and 'the philosopher Anonymous'.[8] Their authority among later Greek alchemists was such that the latter often presented their own theories and practices as an interpretation of the Four Books.[9]

Some Greek alchemists also wrote commentaries on the Four Books. One such commentary, called Democritean Commentaries and written by the alchemist Petasius, is now lost. However, another commentary, called The Philosopher Synesius to Dioscorus: Notes on Democritus' Book, is still extant.[10]
