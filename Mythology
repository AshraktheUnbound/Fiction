The Fall of the City of Belkar
The mud people lived in prosperity and harmony for two thousand years until the High Priest of the City of Belkar enacted a ritual to summon an iron meteor from the depths of the black sky.
The ritual lasted many weeks and required many sacrifices supplied by the peoples of the surrounding lands. The kings of these lands rebelled and joined in a great army to fight Belkar.
Utun, son of the Great Chief Utul in the lands of Kaba, had fought his way to a high mountain pass and gazed upon the city below as the night of the meteors arrival had come.
The meteor was as large as a mountain and streaked through the sky impossibly fast. It shown with a heat and light that all in the valley could feel and see as if the day had come.
A great shield of light twice as large as the city appeared in the sky. The meteor halted for a brief moment before the shield shattered into countless shards that melted into the air.
The city shown as bright as day as the mountain crashed into it annihilating Belkar and its people completely. The sky rained burning rocks and the ground shook. Everything burned.
The fertile lands of the valley below had been changed into a lake of lava and the very air became unbeathable as black clouds swirled above the ground. The City of Belkar was destroyed.

Creation and the First Ritual
In the beginning only the dark mother of the black sky existed. In time she created three daughters. The Sun, the moon, and the earth. The sun in turn created the wanderers in the sky and the moon created the stars. The earth took herself and created the mud people. These crude people lived in a vast land and needed no food, or water. Their numbers grew over the years until even the vast land the earth provided was not enough. The mud people desperatly searched for a solution to their problems. They observed the black sky and gleaned knowledge of the cycles of the heavens. They developed simple runes to harness the fabric of reality. In time one amongst them emerged with a plan. The mud people waited for the time of a great conjunction of the wanderers. Below on earth, the people had erected a mountain of mud upon which they opened themselves and let the life flow from them into sacred geometries dug into the ground. At the moment of conjunction the wanderers answered the call of the mud people.
